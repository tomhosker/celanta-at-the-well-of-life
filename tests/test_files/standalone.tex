\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
    Gently dip, but not too deep,\\*
    For fear you make the golden beard to weep.\\
    Fair maiden, white and red,\\
    Comb me smooth, and stroke my head,\\*
    And thou shalt have some cockell bread.\\!

    Gently dip, but not too deep,\\*
    For fear thou make the golden beard to weep.\\
    Fair maid, white and red,\\
    Comb me smooth, and stroke my head,\\
    And every hair a sheaf shall be,\\*
    And every sheaf a golden tree.
\end{verse}
