How did I meet her? I was living in Pembrokeshire at the time -- that's where I'm from -- and I was working as a cashier at a tourist spot. It was a dairy farm once upon a time; then in 1986 the herd manager decided to turn it into a kind of rustic theme park, adding donkey rides, a fairground, candyfloss, even a gift shop. It was a shrewd decision. She -- the proprietress -- had just come into her inheritance. (There were stories about her father having fallen off of his yacht, but I believe he actually died peacefully in a hotel room in Picadilly.) The old farm happened to be one of her family's holdings. She decided to pay us a visit, inspect the troops, or something like that; that was what we were told. She came down to our section when most of us were on a break, and, because this was the early 1990s and it was a nice day, everyone was smoking. Except I wasn't: I've ever been precious about my health, or anything; I've just never been able to tolerate the sensation of smoke in my throat. She did try to be friendly -- she talked to a couple of us -- but she couldn't stop herself from making a face whenever a puff of smoke drifted towards her nostrils. As she left, she touched me lightly on my right shoulder. I know now that that was the signal for her staff: this is the one I want.
