\section{}

How did I meet her? I was living in Pembrokeshire at the time -- that's where I'm from -- and I was working as a cashier at a tourist spot. It was a dairy farm once upon a time; then in 1986 the herd manager decided to turn it into a kind of rustic theme park, adding donkey rides, a fairground, candyfloss, even a gift shop. It was a shrewd decision. She -- the proprietress -- had just come into her inheritance. (There were stories about her father having fallen off of his yacht, but I believe he actually died peacefully in a hotel room in Picadilly.) The old farm happened to be one of her family's holdings. She decided to pay us a visit, inspect the troops, or something like that; that was what we were told. She came down to our section when most of us were on a break, and, because this was the early 1990s and it was a nice day, everyone was smoking. Except I wasn't: I've ever been precious about my health, or anything; I actually like the smell; I've just never been able to tolerate the sensation of smoke in my throat. She did try to be friendly -- she talked to a couple of us -- but she couldn't stop herself from making a face whenever a puff of smoke drifted towards her nostrils. As she left, she touched me lightly on my right shoulder. I know now that that was the signal for her staff: this is the one I want.

When I turned up for work a couple of days later, my boss asked me if I could work late. I told him yes, and he explained that I had a special task; upper management were canvassing frontline workers. Best behaviour, and all that. A car arrived at five o'clock to pick me up. The driver's name was George; he told me he had worked the proprietress' family all his life, in one role or another. He drove me to an old stonebuilt farmhouse -- from the front, it looked like it had six or seven bedrooms -- about fifteen minutes out of Milford Haven. It was a good spot: half a mile from the Coastal Path, but still with a good view of the sea. George showed me into the front room, and there was the proprietress to meet me with Welsh cakes and a pot of coffee.

We talked about nothing for maybe twenty minutes. She told me to call her Ellie. She asked me how I was treated at the farm. I couldn't complain. Then she pointed out that I'd barely touched my coffee since I'd sat down.

`To tell you the truth, I don't really drink coffee. I'm not a Mormon or anything. I just don't like the taste.'

She asked me if I would prefer a proper drink. I said I would, so she told me to follow her. She led me upstairs, into what looked to be her own room.

`Take a seat,' she said. There was nowhere to sit but the bed. `I'm living out of a suitcase at the moment, but I always make sure the fundamentals are taken care of.' She gestured to one corner of the room, in which there was a kind of impromptu bar. `What can I get you?'

`Oh. John Smith's please, if you've got it,' I said, trying to be manly. It was a warm evening. Had she not been there to impress, I would have poured myself a gin and tonic.

`I do have it.' She handed me a can and a pint glass. Then she poured out a bottle of Old Peculier, and, having admired her work for a few moments, took a small sip.

`Forgive me for saying so,' I said, `but you don't often see a woman enjoying that kind of beer.

She smiled at me. She had an exceptionally warm smile, almost comical, as if her mouth was too big for her face. `My father was a recovering alcoholic,' she said. `When I was little, my mum used to ship me off to stay with him for a few weeks. He had a farm in Normandy. We taught me to drive a tractor. And I used to drink his non-alcholic beer. I was eight years old, and I loved the taste of it straight away.'

She asked me to tell her about myself. I told her there wasn't much to tell. She told me to tell her anyway. So I told her my story: how I had been studying physics at Bristol, how I had got my girlfriend pregnant, how I had dropped out and found a job, how she had had an abortion at twenty-three weeks.

I noticed her widening her eyes in sympathy. The she pulled a book from the shelf nearest the bed and sat down next to me. She opened the book at a specific page and gave it to me; it was a poem.

`I can't read French,' I explained. `If it was Welsh, I might have half a chance, but --'

`That's all right,' she said. `I can translate for you.' She put her finger on the first line: `\textit{Il pleure dans mon coeur} -- It rains in my heart.' I forget the rest.

Once she had finished reading -- I think it was only a dozen or so lines -- she closed the book and put it back. Then she kissed me. When I opened my eyes, I noticed that she was already watching me, and it seemed as if she had been watching my reaction the whole time, like I was an amuse-bouche, one of several, and she was trying to decide which one she liked best. Her eyes were a very vibrant blue, like the waters off the Costa del Sol in the glossy package holiday brochures they had back then. She was sorry, she said, but she had a meeting in London the following morning; she had to leave shortly, and she hadn't yet packed. George would drive me home.

`But one more thing,' she said as I began to get up, and kissed me again.

George picked me up after work again the following week, and brought me back to Ellie and her farmhouse. I remember her hugging me as soon as I walked in.
