Gently dip, but not too deep,
For fear you make the golden beard to weep.
Fair maiden, white #ADD red,
Comb me smooth, and stroke my head,
And thou shalt have some cockell bread.

Gently dip, but not too deep,
For fear thou make the golden beard to weep.
Fair maid, white #ADD red,
Comb me smooth, and stroke my head,
And every hair a sheaf shall be,
And every sheaf a golden tree.
